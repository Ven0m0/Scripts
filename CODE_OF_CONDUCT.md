## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)

- Project-related communications (email, social media, etc.)

It also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer at **ven0m0.wastaken@gmail.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

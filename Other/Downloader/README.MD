You need to download [yt-dl](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases) and [spotdl](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader/releases) and put them in the same folder as the scripts for it to work. It will download the music/video files to your music folder under your user account. You also need to get FFMPEG, get it by simply running the cmd file in the same directory as you have your spotdl executable. PS: rename the spotdl exe file to "spotdl.exe"
